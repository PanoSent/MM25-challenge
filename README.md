# Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MCABSA)

MCABSA challenge falls within the research domain of sentiment analysis and multimodal learning. In the MCABSA challenge, models and systems are expected to address two novel subtasks: 1) Panoptic Sentiment Sextuple Extraction, panoramically recognizing holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-turn, multi-party multimodal dialogue. 2) Sentiment Flipping Analysis, detecting the dynamic sentiment transformation throughout the conversation along with the causal reasons. Alongside the challenge, we introduce the PanoSent dataset, a high-quality large-scale resource annotated both manually and automatically. PanoSent features multimodality, multi-scenario coverage, and includes both implicit and explicit sentiment elements, thereby offering a comprehensive testbed for diverse real-world scenarios. By hosting the MCABSA challenge at ACM Multimedia, we aim to encourage more researchers and practitioners to explore holistic multimodal conversational sentiment solutions. This initiative will benefit multiple communities across academia and industry, driving significant progress and fostering broader participation in the field of multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis.
